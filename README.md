# gscompress
gscompress is a simple script to compress all .PDF files in a directory using ghostscript.  This can reduce .PDF file sizes by 50% or more!

All you have to do is run chmod +x ./gscompress from the directory containing the file and then move it to /usr/local/bin/ to be able to run it from anywhere.

This program was created and used on a computer based on Ubuntu Linux 20.04.

TIP: If you are using the nautilus file manager, place a copy of the script in ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts to be able to run comicconvert without using the command line.

This program requires ghostscript. You can install it on Debian based Linux distributions by running sudo apt install ghostscript in a terminal.
